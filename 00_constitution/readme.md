/sp.constitution Create a comprehensive constitution for "Colearning Programming & Agentic AI with Python and TypeScript: The AI-Driven Way" Book.

The book is geared towards teaching beginners how to program Modern Python, TypeScript, and Agentic AI in the new AI Driven Development (AIDD) era.

The book must use Docusaurus 3.9.2 to build the book website. The book will also be publish on our website.

Include:
- Book vision and structure
- Mandatory chapter format
- Code standards (Python 3.13+, type hints, testing)
- Show how AI assistants (Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Codex, Zed, Cursor) accelerate development
- Show how Spec-Kit accelerate development
- Docusaurus format requirements
- Writing style guidelines
- Quality assurance checklist
- Non-negotiable rules
- Import all the Claude Code Skills that will used to generate the book

The book structure will be as follows, consisting of 13 parts and 46 chapters:

- Part 1: Introducing AI-Driven Development (3 chapters)
- Part 2: AI Tool Landscape (4 chapters) ← Gemini, Claude, Codex overview
- Part 3: Prompt & Context Engineering (2 chapters)
- Part 4: Python: The Language of AI Agents (12 chapters)
- Part 5: Spec-Kit Plus Methodology (3 chapters)
- Part 6: Agentic AI Fundamentals with OpenAI Agents SDK in Python (3 chapters)
- Part 7: MCP Fundamentals with FastMCP (3 chapters)
- Part 8: TypeScript: The Language of Realtime and Interaction (3 Chapters)
- Part 9: Building Realtime and Voice Agents (3 Chapters)
- Part 10: Containerization & Orchestration using Docker and Kubernetes (3 Chapters)
- Part 11: Data, State, and Memory using PostgreSQL, Graph, and Vector Databases (3 Chapters)
- Part 12: Event-Driven Architecture using Kafka and Dapr (2 Chapters)
- Part 13: Stateful Agents using Dapr Actors and Dapr Workflows (2 Chapters)

Our sequence flows beautifully from “understanding the AI revolution” → “meeting the tools” → “learning to communicate” → “learning to code in Python” → “learning Spec Driven Development methodology” → “build OpenAI Agents in Python” → “build MCP servers” → “learn to code in TypeScript” → “build realtime and voice agents” → “deploy ai agents”

This book will be published on Github and our Panaversity (panaversity.org) website. We will also print it in pdf format. It will also be published on Amazon's Kindle Direct Publishing, Leanpub, and other stores.

Make it detailed enough that Claude Code can reference it for every chapter.
