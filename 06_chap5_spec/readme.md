[Anthropic Didn't Mean to Build It, But It's Changed Everything](https://www.pcmag.com/news/claude-code-creator-we-didnt-mean-to-build-it-but-its-changed-everything)

Often [credited as the trailblazer](https://www.startuphub.ai/ai-news/ai-video/2025/claude-code-ushers-in-a-new-era-of-agentic-programming/), Claude Code started as a command-line AI assistant built around Anthropic’s Claude model. It quickly proved so useful that even its creators were surprised – they “didn’t mean to build it” exactly, but it took on a life of its own and “changed everything” about how they code. Claude Code can read and modify large codebases, generate and edit files, and even use tools or access a browser through a safe interface. Initially available as a terminal-based tool for pros, it’s now accessible via the web to anyone, reflecting its broad appeal. Developers praise Claude Code for its polished, reliable performance (it’s known as an extremely fast and stable agent for complex coding tasks). In short, it’s like having an ultra-smart pair programmer who doesn’t just advise – it executes on your behalf.

Anthropic claims that approximately 90% of Claude Code itself was written by their own AI models, which tells you everything you need to know about where we're heading. The engineers at Anthropic rarely touch keyboards to write code anymore—they've become reviewers and orchestrators.

Claude Code didn't just introduce a new tool; it validated an entirely new paradigm for software development. Launched initially as a command-line interface and now available via web interface and mobile apps, Claude Code enables developers to delegate multiple coding tasks that run on cloud infrastructure. You can kick off several parallel tasks, each in its own isolated environment, and the agent handles implementation while you track progress in real-time.

This chapter will serve as a tutorial for beginners for Claude Code using the official documentation links below. Place special emphasis on installing, Subagents, Agent Skills, and connecting MCP servers. Agent Skills have been announced recently but they are very important because we can create a vertical agent skill library for our domain, startup, and company giving us a competetive advantage.

The magic? You stay in control with approval modes ranging from full manual review to autonomous execution. Claude Code now features **checkpoints** for autonomous operation, **subagents** that delegate specialized tasks for parallel workflows, **Skills** to improve how it performs specific tasks, and **hooks** that automatically trigger actions at specific points like running test suites after code changes.
