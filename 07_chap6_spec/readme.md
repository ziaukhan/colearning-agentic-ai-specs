/sp.specify Write chapter 6 in Part 2 of the book. The title of the chapter will be "Google Gemini CLI: Open Source and Everywhere".

Google didn't just followâ€”they went big. Gemini CLI is fully open source under Apache 2.0 license, bringing the power of Gemini directly into developers' terminals with built-in tools for Google Search grounding, file operations, shell commands, and web fetching.

What makes Gemini CLI particularly compelling is its accessibility. Developers get 60 model requests per minute and 1,000 requests per day at no charge simply by logging in with a personal Google account. That's roughly double the average number of requests developers typically make, according to Google.

The tool uses Gemini 2.5 Pro with its massive 1 million token context window, meaning you can feed it entire codebases for comprehensive analysis. It's built on the Model Context Protocol (MCP), making it extensible with custom tools and integrations.

Recently, Google released [Gemini CLI Extensions](https://blog.google/technology/developers/gemini-cli-extensions/) which is conceptually similar to Claude Code Agent Skills. We can now also create a vertical agent skill library for Gemini CLI for our domain, startup, and company giving us a competetive advantage.

This chapter will serve as a tutorial for beginners for Gemini CLI using the official documentation links below:

The good thing is that Alibaba Qwen Code has forked the Gemini CLI, therefore most things which apply to Gemini CLI it also applies to Qwen Code. What is incrediable is that Developers get 2,000 requests per day at no charge simply by logging in with a personal Qwen account.
