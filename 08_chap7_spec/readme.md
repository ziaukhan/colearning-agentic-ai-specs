/sp.specify Write chapter 7 in Part 2 of the book. The title of the chapter will be "Bash Essentials for AI-Driven Development".

This chapter will server as a minimal guide to get you productive with Bash and Coding Agents like Claude Code and Gemini CLI.

It consists of two parts. The first part covers [Part I: Bash Commands](#part-i-bash-commands). The second [Part II: Natural Language Prompts for Bash](#part-ii-natural-language-prompts-for-bash)

# Part I: Bash Commands

## Navigation & File Management

### Where am I?
```bash
pwd                    # Print working directory (shows current location)
```

### Moving around
```bash
cd project-name        # Go into a folder
cd ..                  # Go up one level
cd ~                   # Go to home directory
cd -                   # Go back to previous directory
```

### Seeing what's here
```bash
ls                     # List files
ls -la                 # List all files (including hidden) with details
tree                   # Show directory structure (may need to install)
```

### Creating & removing
```bash
mkdir my-project       # Create directory
touch file.txt         # Create empty file
rm file.txt            # Delete file
rm -rf folder/         # Delete folder and contents (use carefully!)
```

## Working with Files

### Reading files
```bash
cat file.txt           # Show entire file
head file.txt          # Show first 10 lines
tail file.txt          # Show last 10 lines
tail -f log.txt        # Follow file updates (great for logs)
less file.txt          # Browse file (q to quit, / to search)
```

### Editing files
```bash
nano file.txt          # Simple editor (Ctrl+X to exit)
```

### Copying & moving
```bash
cp source.txt dest.txt           # Copy file
cp -r source-dir/ dest-dir/      # Copy directory
mv old-name.txt new-name.txt     # Rename/move file
```

## Process Management

### Running commands
```bash
command                # Run in foreground
command &              # Run in background
Ctrl+C                 # Stop current process
Ctrl+Z                 # Pause process
```

### Seeing what's running
```bash
ps aux                 # List all processes
top                    # Interactive process viewer (q to quit)
kill 12345             # Stop process with PID 12345
killall process-name   # Stop all processes with that name
```

## AI CLI Essentials

### Environment variables (API keys, etc.)
```bash
export API_KEY="your-key-here"         # Set for current session
echo $API_KEY                          # View variable
env                                    # See all environment variables
```

### Making variables permanent
Add to `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`:
```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-key"
```
Then reload:
```bash
source ~/.bashrc       # Reload bash config
```

### Command history
```bash
history                # See past commands
!123                   # Run command #123 from history
!!                     # Run last command
Ctrl+R                 # Search command history (type to search)
```

## Pipes & Redirection

### Connecting commands
```bash
command1 | command2    # Send output of command1 to command2
cat file.txt | grep "error"        # Find "error" in file
ls | wc -l                          # Count files in directory
```

### Saving output
```bash
command > file.txt     # Save output to file (overwrite)
command >> file.txt    # Append output to file
command 2> errors.txt  # Save errors to file
```

## Package Management

### macOS (Homebrew)
```bash
brew install package-name
brew update
brew upgrade
```

### Ubuntu/Debian
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install package-name
```

### Python packages
```bash
pip install package-name
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Node packages
```bash
npm install package-name
npm install              # Install from package.json
```

## Useful Shortcuts

```bash
Tab                    # Auto-complete
Tab Tab                # Show all options
Ctrl+A                 # Go to start of line
Ctrl+E                 # Go to end of line
Ctrl+U                 # Clear line
Ctrl+L                 # Clear screen (or type 'clear')
Ctrl+D                 # Exit terminal/shell
```

## Finding Things

```bash
find . -name "*.py"              # Find Python files
grep "search-term" file.txt      # Search in file
grep -r "search-term" .          # Search in all files recursively
which python                     # Find program location
```

## Permissions (when you get "permission denied")

```bash
chmod +x script.sh     # Make file executable
sudo command           # Run with admin privileges
```

## Common Patterns for AI CLI Work

### Check what's installed
```bash
which claude           # Check if Claude CLI is installed
python --version       # Check Python version
node --version         # Check Node version
```

### Create project structure
```bash
mkdir -p project/{src,tests,docs}    # Create nested folders
cd project && git init               # Initialize git repo
touch README.md .gitignore           # Create essential files
```

### Monitor AI CLI output
```bash
claude code "task" | tee output.log  # Show output AND save to file
```

### Chain AI operations
```bash
claude analyze code.py > analysis.txt && cat analysis.txt
```

## Quick Troubleshooting

**Command not found?**
- Check if installed: `which command-name`
- Check PATH: `echo $PATH`
- Reinstall or add to PATH

**Permission denied?**
- Try `chmod +x filename` for scripts
- Use `sudo` for system operations
- Check file ownership: `ls -la`

**API key not working?**
- Check it's set: `echo $API_KEY`
- Reload config: `source ~/.bashrc`
- Check for typos in variable name

## Pro Tips

1. Use `!!` to quickly rerun the last command with sudo: `sudo !!`
2. Use `Ctrl+R` to search history - huge time saver
3. Create aliases for common commands in `~/.bashrc`:
   ```bash
   alias ll='ls -la'
   alias gs='git status'
   ```
4. Use `man command` to read documentation for any command
5. When copying commands from AI, understand what they do before running

## Next Steps

This covers 90% of what you'll need for AI-driven development. As you work:
- Commands will become muscle memory
- You'll discover shortcuts specific to your workflow
- Your AI assistant can help with complex one-liners when needed

**Remember:** You don't need to memorize everything. Keep this guide handy and refer back as needed. The AI tools you're using can also help explain bash commands when you're stuck!

## Part II: Natural Language Prompts for Bash

This part provides natural language prompts you can use with AI CLI tools like Claude Code, Gemini CLI, and similar assistants to execute the Bash commands covered in the tutorial. The format shows the bash command first, followed by natural language prompts you can use to have the AI execute that command.
