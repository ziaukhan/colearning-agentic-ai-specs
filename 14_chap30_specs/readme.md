# Understanding Spec-Driven Development

The emergence of powerful AI coding agents has highlighted a critical need for a new development methodology to move beyond "vibe-coding" quick prototypes to building **mission-critical applications**. This methodology is **Spec-Driven Development (SDD)**.

Instead of coding first and writing docs later, in spec-driven development, you start with a spec. This is a contract for how your code should behave and becomes the source of truth your tools and AI agents use to generate, test, and validate code. The result is less guesswork, fewer surprises, and higher-quality code.

As coding agents have grown more powerful, a pattern has emerged: you describe your goal, get a block of code back, and often... it looks right, but doesn't quite work. This "vibe-coding" approach can be great for quick prototypes, but less reliable when building serious, mission-critical applications or working with existing codebases.

The issue isn't the coding agent's coding ability, but our approach. We treat coding agents like search engines when we should be treating them more like literal-minded pair programmers. They excel at pattern recognition but still need unambiguous instructions.

## The Problem with Vibe Coding

As coding agents have grown more powerful, a new pattern of development has emerged: you describe your goal, receive a block of code, and — at first glance — it looks right. The structure seems reasonable, the syntax clean, and the logic plausible. But when you run it… it doesn’t quite work. This “vibe coding” approach — coding by intuition or conversational suggestion — is great for rapid prototypes, but fragile when used for production-grade or mission-critical systems.

The problem isn’t that coding agents are poor programmers; in fact, they’re remarkably good. The problem is that we, as developers, often treat them like search engines — loosely describing what we want and expecting perfect precision in return. Coding agents, however, are more like literal-minded pair programmers: they thrive on clarity, structure, and constraints. Without those, they can only infer intent from patterns.

That’s where Spec Driven Development (SDD) comes in.

---

## Defining Spec-Driven Development

**Spec-Driven Development** (SDD) is an approach where a comprehensive, structured **specification** is authored *before* writing code. This specification serves as the **single source of truth**—a contract for the code's expected behavior—that both humans and AI agents use to generate, test, and validate the implementation.

SDD is a methodology where software specifications are created before implementation begins, serving as both a blueprint and a contract between intent and execution. Unlike traditional documentation that often becomes outdated or is written after the fact, specs in SDD are living documents that actively guide the development process.

At its core, a spec is a structured, behavior-oriented artifact—or a set of related artifacts—written in natural language that expresses software functionality and serves as guidance to AI coding agents. Each variant of spec-driven development defines its approach to a spec's structure, level of detail, and how these artifacts are organized within a project.

The key distinction of SDD in the age of AI coding agents is that these specs become the primary interface for AI collaboration. Rather than generating code from loose natural language descriptions, AI agents work from structured specifications that leave less room for misinterpretation.

In SDD, you are not treating the coding agent as a simple code generator; you're leveraging it as a literal-minded, highly capable **pair programmer** that excels when given explicit, unambiguous instructions. The focus shifts from rapidly producing code snippets to meticulously defining intent.

SDD is a software engineering methodology where development begins with a specification — a structured, machine-readable description of how the code should behave.
This specification acts as a contract between the developer and the coding agent. It defines inputs, outputs, constraints, design principles, and test expectations before any code is written.

Instead of coding first and documenting later, SDD reverses the order:

1. Write the spec.
Define what you want — not in prose, but in structured form.

2. Generate code.
Let coding agents produce implementations that conform to the spec.

3. Test and validate.
The spec becomes the reference truth used by automated validators or agents to verify correctness.

This approach minimizes guesswork, aligns all stakeholders, and creates a traceable record of why and how decisions were made.

However, it's important to note that "spec-driven development" exists at multiple implementation levels:

- **Spec-first**: A well thought-out spec is written first, and then used in the AI-assisted development workflow for the task at hand.
- **Spec-anchored**: The spec is kept even after the task is complete, to continue using it for evolution and maintenance of the respective feature.
- **Spec-as-source**: The spec is the main source file over time, and only the spec is edited by the human; the human never touches the code.

All SDD approaches are spec-first, but not all strive to be spec-anchored or spec-as-source. Understanding which level a tool targets is crucial for evaluating its fit for your development needs.

### What is a Spec?

A **spec** (or specification) is a structured, behavior-oriented artifact, typically written in natural language, that clearly expresses a piece of software's functionality, constraints, and success criteria.

It is **more than just documentation**; it is an *executable* contract that drives the entire development lifecycle. A good spec should be detailed enough to answer the *what* (user stories, requirements, constraints) and inform the *how* (technical context, integration points) without over-specifying the exact code implementation.

It is a formal description of what a system, function, or component should do. In the SDD context, it’s not just a text file — it’s a living document that drives generation, validation, and memory.

A good spec typically includes:

- Intent: What problem the system solves.
- Inputs and Outputs: Data formats, constraints, and expectations.
- Functional Requirements: What must always be true.
- Non-Functional Requirements: Performance, reliability, scalability, etc.
- Test Scenarios: Example inputs and expected outputs.
- Contextual Principles: Design philosophies, architecture rules, or “immutable laws.”

In essence, a spec isn’t a suggestion — it’s a constitution for your project.

---

### The Role of Memory Banks

An important distinction exists between specs and the more general context documents for a codebase. This general context—things like rules files or high-level descriptions of the product and codebase—is what some tools call a "memory bank." These files are relevant across all AI coding sessions in the codebase, whereas specs are only relevant to the tasks that actually create or change that particular functionality.

Think of the memory bank as the persistent knowledge that every AI interaction should reference, while specs are ephemeral (or semi-permanent) artifacts tied to specific features or changes.



## The Evolution and Origins of Spec-Driven Development

While the principles of specification-driven design have existed in software engineering for decades—from formal methods in the 1970s to Design by Contract in the 1980s—the modern incarnation of SDD emerged as a response to the capabilities and limitations of AI coding assistants.

The trend began gaining traction in 2023-2024 as developers working with early AI coding tools like GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT noticed a consistent pattern: the quality of generated code was highly dependent on the clarity and structure of the request. Teams that maintained detailed technical specifications saw dramatically better results than those relying on ad-hoc prompts.

The first formal tools to crystallize this approach emerged in 2024-2025, each taking different approaches to the spec-driven philosophy:

### [Early SDD Tools: Kiro, Spec-Kit, and Tessl Framework](https://martinfowler.com/articles/exploring-gen-ai/sdd-3-tools.html)

**[Kiro](https://kiro.dev/)** emerged as one of the simplest and most lightweight approaches to spec-driven development. Distributed as a VS Code extension, Kiro provides a straightforward three-step workflow that guides developers through Requirements, Design, and Tasks. Its lightweight nature makes it approachable for teams new to SDD, though it primarily operates at the spec-first level.

**[GitHub's Spec-Kit](https://github.com/github/spec-kit)** was released as an experimental project in early 2024, introducing the most comprehensive and structured approach to SDD. Rather than being just another documentation framework, Spec-Kit was designed specifically to bridge human intent and AI execution with its concept of a "Constitution"—immutable principles that govern all development decisions.

**[Tessl Framework](https://tessl.io/blog/announcing-tessls-products-to-unlock-the-power-of-agents/)** (still in private beta as of late 2025) is the most ambitious of the early tools, explicitly targeting spec-as-source development where specs serve as the primary artifacts that developers maintain, with code being generated and never directly edited.


## Inside Kiro: Simplicity as a Feature

Kiro represents the minimalist approach to spec-driven development. Its philosophy is that SDD shouldn't require learning complex workflows or managing numerous files. Instead, it provides three markdown documents that guide you through the development process.

### The Kiro Workflow: Requirements → Design → Tasks

**Requirements Document**

Kiro structures requirements as a list where each requirement represents a user story in "As a..." format, accompanied by acceptance criteria in "GIVEN... WHEN... THEN..." format. This makes the requirements immediately recognizable to teams already practicing Agile or BDD.

For example, a requirement might look like:
```
1. As a user, I want to filter products by category
   - GIVEN I am on the product listing page
   - WHEN I select a category from the filter dropdown
   - THEN I should see only products in that category
```

This format is straightforward and familiar, but it can lead to over-specification for small tasks. When asked to fix a minor bug, Kiro might expand it into multiple user stories with numerous acceptance criteria, turning a simple fix into what feels like a full feature specification.

**Design Document**

The design phase produces a single markdown document with sections that vary based on the task but typically include:
- Architecture overview
- Component breakdown
- Data models
- Integration points
- Technical considerations

Unlike Spec-Kit's multiple interconnected files, Kiro keeps everything in one place, making it easier to review but potentially less modular for complex systems.

**Tasks Document**

The final phase breaks down the design into discrete, numbered tasks that trace back to specific requirements. Kiro enhances this document with UI elements in VS Code that let you:
- Execute tasks one by one
- Review changes per task
- Track completion status

This task-by-task approach provides clear checkpoints and makes it easier to work incrementally.

### Kiro's Memory Bank: "Steering"

Kiro calls its memory bank concept "steering." Unlike Spec-Kit's Constitution, Kiro's steering documents are more flexible and the workflow doesn't strictly depend on any specific files being present. The default topology when you generate steering documents includes:

- `product.md`: Product vision and goals
- `structure.md`: Codebase organization and architecture patterns
- `tech.md`: Technology stack and technical standards

This flexibility is both a strength and a weakness. It's easier to adopt Kiro without extensive setup, but teams may lack the discipline to establish strong foundational principles that the AI consistently respects.

### Kiro's Trade-offs

**Strengths:**
- Low barrier to entry
- Familiar workflow structure (requirements → design → tasks)
- Easy to review with only three main documents
- Good for teams new to SDD

**Limitations:**
- Primarily spec-first, not spec-anchored
- Can be overkill for small changes
- Less structured enforcement of principles compared to Spec-Kit
- May produce verbose specifications even for simple tasks
- Limited guidance on spec maintenance over time

Kiro works best for medium-sized features where the Requirements → Design → Tasks workflow maps naturally to the problem scope. For very small bugs or very large features, its one-size-fits-all approach can feel mismatched.

## Inside GitHub's Spec-Kit: Constitutional Development

Spec-Kit represents the most elaborate and structured approach to spec-driven development. Where Kiro focuses on simplicity, Spec-Kit emphasizes comprehensiveness and enforceability.

### The Architecture of Principles

Spec-Kit's architecture is built around a concept they call the **Constitution**—a set of high-level, immutable principles that govern all development decisions. Think of it as the foundational law that every change, every line of code, and every architectural decision must respect.

The Constitution typically contains:

- **Core principles**: Fundamental design philosophies (e.g., "All user data must be encrypted at rest")
- **Non-negotiable constraints**: Technical requirements that cannot be violated (e.g., "API response time must be under 200ms")
- **Architectural patterns**: Required approaches to common problems (e.g., "Use event-driven architecture for cross-service communication")
- **Quality gates**: Standards that define acceptable code (e.g., "Test coverage must exceed 80%")

This Constitution serves as a powerful rules file that permeates every step of the Spec-Kit workflow. Unlike traditional style guides or best practices documents that developers might consult occasionally, the Constitution is actively referenced and enforced by AI agents throughout the development process.

As we discussed, the foundation of Spec-Kit is the **constitution** (`constitution.md`). This document is Spec-Kit’s **memory bank** for immutable, high-level principles that must be applied to every change. It acts as a powerful rules file, capturing organizational standards, code quality guidelines, testing requirements, and compliance constraints that the AI agent must respect during the entire workflow. This constitution defines **immutable principles** — high-level rules and values that guide every generation, modification, and review step. It ensures consistency across projects, like a legal framework for your AI-assisted codebase.

In practice, it acts as a **meta-spec** — a governing file that shapes how all other specs are interpreted.

Example principles might include:

- Every feature must include a test plan.
- No hardcoded credentials.
- Maintain backward compatibility.
- Preserve architectural integrity across updates.

The Constitution ensures that even when agents generate new code, the system’s core values remain intact.

### The Spec-Kit Workflow: Constitution → 𝄆 Specify → Plan → Tasks 𝄇

Spec-Kit structures development into three repeatable phases, each producing multiple interconnected files:

**1. Specify Phase**

In this phase, you define *what* needs to be built. The AI agent helps you:
- Clarify ambiguous requirements by asking targeted questions
- Identify edge cases and potential issues early
- Check for Constitution violations before any code is written
- Generate a formal specification document

The specification isn't a single file but rather a collection that might include:
- Core specification document
- Requirements checklist
- Research notes on existing code
- Clarification requests for stakeholders

The checklist for this phase includes items like:
- [ ] All user stories have acceptance criteria
- [ ] Edge cases have been identified and addressed
- [ ] No conflicts with Constitutional principles
- [ ] Stakeholder questions resolved

**2. Plan Phase**

Here, you determine *how* to build it. This phase produces:
- Architectural diagrams and component breakdowns
- Technology stack decisions with justifications
- Integration points and dependencies
- Risk assessment and mitigation strategies
- Research findings from existing codebase analysis

The planning checklist ensures:
- [ ] Architecture aligns with Constitutional patterns
- [ ] All dependencies are documented and justified
- [ ] Performance implications are understood
- [ ] Rollback strategy is defined

**3. Tasks Phase**

Finally, you break down the implementation into discrete, actionable tasks. Each task:
- Has clear acceptance criteria tied back to the spec
- Includes test requirements
- Specifies which parts of the Constitution are most relevant
- Contains enough context for an AI coding agent to implement independently

The tasks checklist verifies:
- [ ] Each task is independently implementable
- [ ] Test coverage requirements are specified
- [ ] All tasks trace back to requirements in the spec
- [ ] Task dependencies are clearly mapped

Checklists are integral to each phase, serving as a **"definition of done."** They help track necessary user clarifications, research tasks, and constitution violations, guiding both the human developer and the AI agent toward a compliant and complete artifact for that step.

These checklists are mini contracts that verify completeness, research needs, or constitution violations.
These are the AI’s “Definition of Done” indicators, creating traceability through every iteration.


### The File Topology Challenge

One of Spec-Kit's defining characteristics—and potential drawbacks—is the sheer number of files it generates. A single spec might consist of:
- Constitution documents (shared across all specs)
- Specification files
- Planning files
- Task breakdowns
- Research notes
- Various checklists

This creates a comprehensive paper trail but also presents a significant review burden. Where Kiro gives you three markdown files to review, Spec-Kit might generate a dozen or more, with content that can be repetitive both across files and with existing code.

### The Branch-Per-Spec Model

Spec-Kit creates a separate branch for every spec, which reveals an interesting philosophical question: Is a spec meant to be a living artifact for the lifetime of a feature, or just for the lifetime of a change request?

GitHub's documentation suggests aspiration toward spec-anchoring ("specifications — not as static documents, but as living, executable artifacts that evolve with the project"), but the branch-per-spec implementation suggests specs might be more ephemeral. This ambiguity has led to community discussion about whether Spec-Kit is truly spec-anchored or primarily spec-first.

### The Technical Implementation

Spec-Kit orchestrates its workflow through bash scripts and templating. At each phase transition, the system:

1. Instantiates a new set of files from templates
2. Populates them with context from previous phases
3. Generates phase-specific prompts for the AI agent
4. Creates checklists that serve as the "definition of done"

These checklists are particularly clever. Rather than being rigid gate-checks that block progress, they're interpreted by AI agents as guidelines. The AI can mark items complete, flag items that need human attention, or identify Constitutional violations that require architectural changes. While not providing 100% guarantee of compliance, they significantly improve consistency and quality.

### Spec-Kit's Trade-offs

**Strengths:**
- Strong enforcement of architectural principles
- Comprehensive documentation trail
- Highly customizable (everything in your workspace)
- Works with multiple AI coding assistants
- Systematic approach to complex problems

**Limitations:**
- Steep learning curve
- Heavy review burden with many files
- Can feel like overkill for medium-sized features
- Unclear spec lifecycle (spec-first vs spec-anchored)
- May amplify existing challenges like review overload

Spec-Kit shines when building complex systems where architectural discipline is paramount, but the overhead may not justify the benefits for smaller codebases or routine maintenance work.

## Comparing Approaches: Finding the Right Fit

The differences between Kiro and Spec-Kit highlight a fundamental tension in spec-driven development: simplicity versus rigor.

| Aspect | Kiro | Spec-Kit |
|--------|------|----------|
| **Complexity** | Lightweight | Comprehensive |
| **File Count** | 3 documents | 10+ documents |
| **Memory Bank** | Steering (flexible) | Constitution (structured) |
| **Workflow Steps** | 3 (Req → Design → Tasks) | 3 repeatable (Specify → Plan → Tasks) |
| **Principle Enforcement** | Soft (via steering) | Hard (via Constitution) |
| **Learning Curve** | Low | High |
| **Best For** | Medium-sized features | Complex systems |
| **Spec Level** | Spec-first | Spec-first (aspiring spec-anchored) |
| **Customization** | Limited | Extensive |

Neither approach is universally better. The choice depends on:
- Team experience with SDD
- Codebase complexity
- Feature size and criticality
- Organizational commitment to architectural discipline
- Tolerance for process overhead

## The Tessl Vision: Spec-as-Source

While Kiro and Spec-Kit represent different points on the spec-first spectrum, Tessl Framework (still in private beta) pushes into spec-as-source territory—a fundamentally different paradigm.

In Tessl's vision, specs aren't just guides for development; they become the *only* thing developers maintain. Code is generated from specs and marked with comments like `// GENERATED FROM SPEC - DO NOT EDIT`. This creates a 1:1 mapping between spec files and code files, at least in current implementations.

A Tessl spec might look like:

```
# User Authentication Service

@generate
@test

## Purpose
Handles user authentication and session management

## API
- `authenticateUser(username, password) -> SessionToken`
- `validateSession(token) -> boolean`
- `invalidateSession(token) -> void`

## Behavior
- Passwords must be hashed using bcrypt with cost factor 12
- Sessions expire after 24 hours of inactivity
- Failed login attempts are rate-limited to 5 per minute per IP
- All authentication events are logged

## Dependencies
- Database: PostgreSQL users table
- Cache: Redis for session storage
```

Running `tessl build` would generate the corresponding code file, which developers would never directly edit.

### The MDD Echo

This approach strongly echoes Model-Driven Development (MDD) from the 2000s, where models (expressed in UML or DSLs) served as the source of truth and code generators produced implementation. MDD ultimately struggled with:
- Awkward abstraction levels
- Inflexibility and overhead
- Tools that constrained more than they enabled

LLMs potentially solve some of these problems—natural language is more flexible than formal modeling languages, and you don't need to build custom code generators. However, they introduce new challenges:
- Non-determinism (running `tessl build` twice might produce different code)
- Loss of tool support for ensuring spec completeness and consistency
- The same awkward abstraction level problem, just in a new form

Whether spec-as-source with LLMs can succeed where MDD failed remains an open question. The non-determinism alone is a significant hurdle—how do you version control when your build isn't reproducible?

## Critical Questions for SDD Adoption

Having examined these tools, several critical questions emerge that teams must address before adopting spec-driven development:

### One Workflow to Fit All Sizes?

Both Kiro and Spec-Kit provide opinionated workflows, but real-world coding problems vary enormously in size and complexity. Using Kiro to fix a one-line bug feels like using a sledgehammer to crack a nut. Using Spec-Kit for a medium-sized feature might mean spending more time reviewing markdown than you would have spent just coding.

An effective SDD approach needs flexibility—perhaps multiple workflow patterns for different problem scales, or a way to gracefully degrade the process for simpler changes.

### Reviewing Markdown Over Code?

One of the surprising realities of SDD is that you trade code review for specification review. With Spec-Kit, you might review a dozen verbose markdown files that repeat each other and existing code. With Kiro, even simple tasks expand into multi-story specifications.

Many developers find they'd rather review code—it's more concrete, you can run it, and you have decades of tooling for diffs, static analysis, and testing. Specifications, by contrast, are prose that require careful reading and reasoning about hypothetical behavior.

For SDD to succeed at scale, the specification review experience needs to be *better* than code review, not just different.

### False Sense of Control?

Despite all the structure, templates, checklists, and constitutional principles, AI agents still don't always follow instructions. They might:
- Generate duplicate code that ignores research notes
- Misinterpret which principles apply to a situation
- Over-eagerly follow one instruction while ignoring others
- Miss crucial context despite large context windows

The elaborate scaffolding of SDD tools can create a false sense of control. The process *looks* rigorous, but the AI at the center of it still operates probabilistically, not deterministically.

### Separation of Functional and Technical?

A common aspiration in SDD is cleanly separating functional requirements ("what") from technical implementation ("how"). The promise is that eventually, AI could generate any implementation from the same functional spec—even switching technology stacks.

In practice, this separation is notoriously difficult. When do you move from functional to technical? What counts as "purely functional"? After decades of poorly-written user stories that conflate requirements with implementation, we don't have a great track record as a profession at maintaining this distinction.

SDD tools don't solve this fundamental problem; they just expose it more visibly.

### Who Is the Target User?

Many SDD tutorials include product requirements, user stories, and feature goals—activities traditionally owned by product managers or business analysts. Is SDD meant to:
- Enable developers to take on product responsibilities?
- Facilitate collaboration between developers and product people?
- Replace product roles with AI-augmented developers?

The target user is left vague, which makes it unclear what problem size and type SDD is meant for. Large, unclear features surely need specialized product skills and stakeholder involvement that go beyond writing good specifications.

## Extending Spec-Kit Plus: Building on the Foundation

Despite these challenges, spec-driven development offers genuine value for teams working on complex systems with AI coding agents. Our fork called Spec-Kit Plus addresses several gaps in the original framework while building toward vertical specialization.

### Horizontal Enhancements: History and Decisions

Two critical additions provide better continuity and learning:

#### Prompt History Records (PHR)

PHRs maintain a structured log of all AI interactions during the development process. Each record captures:

- The prompt or query sent to the AI agent
- The context and phase in which it was used
- The response or code generated
- Whether the output was accepted, modified, or rejected
- The rationale for any changes

This creates an audit trail that serves multiple purposes:

- **Debugging**: When generated code doesn't work as expected, you can trace back through the decision chain to identify where understanding diverged
- **Learning**: Patterns emerge showing which prompts produce better results for specific tasks
- **Compliance**: For regulated industries, having a record of AI-assisted development decisions can be crucial
- **Collaboration**: Team members can understand not just what was built, but the reasoning path that led there

#### Architectural Decision Records (ADR)

While the Constitution defines immutable principles, ADRs capture the mutable decisions made during development. Each ADR documents:

- **Context**: What situation prompted this decision
- **Decision**: What was chosen and why
- **Alternatives considered**: What other options were evaluated
- **Consequences**: What are the implications, both positive and negative
- **Status**: Is this decision current, superseded, or deprecated

ADRs integrate beautifully with Spec-Kit because they provide the "why" behind deviations from obvious paths. When an AI agent encounters a situation where multiple approaches could satisfy the spec, it can reference relevant ADRs to understand the team's philosophy and make consistent choices.

Together, PHRs and ADRs transform Spec-Kit from a forward-looking specification tool into a complete knowledge management system that captures the "what" (specs), the "how" (implementation), and the "why" (decisions) of your codebase.

### Vertical Specialization: Skills and Subagents

The most powerful extension addresses a fundamental limitation: domain expertise. While general-purpose AI coding agents are remarkably capable, they lack deep knowledge of specific industries, frameworks, or architectural patterns that define vertical markets.

Our solution draws inspiration from Claude's Agent Skills concept—modular capabilities that extend what an AI agent can do in specific contexts. By integrating these with Spec-Kit's workflow, we create specialized development pipelines for different domains.

#### The Skills Architecture

A Skill in our extended framework is a package containing:

- **Domain-specific Constitution extensions**: Additional principles for specialized contexts (e.g., HIPAA compliance for healthcare, PCI-DSS for payments)
- **Template libraries**: Pre-built spec templates for common patterns in that vertical (e.g., patient intake workflows, checkout processes)
- **Code pattern repositories**: Reference implementations that demonstrate best practices
- **Validation rules**: Domain-specific checks that go beyond general software quality
- **Integration points**: Pre-configured connections to common tools and services in that industry

For example, a healthcare skill might include:

```yaml
domain: healthcare
constitutional_extensions:
  - "All PHI must be de-identified in logs and analytics"
  - "Audit trails required for all data access"
  - "Patient consent must be verified before data sharing"

templates:
  - patient_registration_spec
  - clinical_note_interface
  - lab_results_integration

validations:
  - hipaa_compliance_check
  - phi_exposure_scan
  - consent_verification

integrations:
  - hl7_fhir_adapter
  - epic_ehr_connector
```

#### Subagent Specialization

Complementing Skills, Subagents are AI agents with specialized training or prompting for specific tasks within the development workflow. Rather than one general-purpose agent handling everything from architecture to implementation, you might have:

- **Compliance Subagent**: Reviews specs and code for regulatory violations
- **Security Subagent**: Focuses on threat modeling and secure implementation
- **Performance Subagent**: Analyzes architectural decisions for scalability implications
- **Integration Subagent**: Specializes in connecting to external services and APIs

During the Spec-Kit workflow, the appropriate Subagent is invoked at each phase. For instance, in the Specify phase for a financial application, the Compliance Subagent would review requirements against PCI-DSS standards, while the Security Subagent would identify potential vulnerabilities in the proposed design.

#### Platform-Native Implementation

Different AI coding agents have different strengths and native capabilities. Rather than forcing a one-size-fits-all solution, we implement vertical libraries using each platform's native extension mechanisms:

- **Claude Agent Skills**: Native to Claude, these allow deep integration with Claude's reasoning capabilities and extended context windows
- **Gemini CLI Extensions**: Conceptually similar to Claude skills, leveraging Google's multimodal capabilities and integration with Google Cloud services


By implementing the same conceptual vertical libraries across platforms, we create portable domain expertise that works regardless of which AI coding agent a team prefers. A healthcare development team using Claude gets the same specialized guidance as one using Gemini, just expressed through each platform's native mechanisms.

## The Semantic Diffusion Problem

As spec-driven development gains attention, the term itself is becoming semantically diffused. People now use "spec" as a synonym for "detailed prompt" or "good instructions." This dilution makes it harder to have productive conversations about what SDD actually means and whether specific practices qualify.

To maintain clarity, it's worth reiterating the core characteristics that distinguish genuine SDD from simply "writing better prompts":

1. **Structured artifacts**: Not just any instructions, but deliberately formatted documents following consistent patterns
2. **Behavior-oriented**: Focus on what the system should do, not just how to implement it
3. **Source of truth**: The spec remains authoritative throughout development, not just a one-time input
4. **Machine and human readable**: Designed for both AI consumption and human review
5. **Integration with workflow**: Specs are part of a broader development process, not standalone documents

Without these characteristics, you're doing good prompting, not spec-driven development. The distinction matters because SDD implies commitments about process, tooling, and long-term maintenance that casual prompting doesn't.

## Lessons from the Past: MDD Revisited

The parallels between spec-driven development and Model-Driven Development deserve deeper examination. Both share a vision: abstract away the implementation details and let developers work at a higher level. Both promise that technology will handle the "boring" part of translating intent to code.

MDD failed to achieve mainstream adoption for business applications because:

1. **Abstraction mismatch**: Models sat at an awkward level—too detailed to be pure requirements, too abstract to fully specify behavior
2. **Tool lock-in**: Custom code generators created dependencies on specific toolchains
3. **Flexibility constraints**: Formal modeling languages couldn't express everything developers needed
4. **Maintenance burden**: Keeping models and code in sync required discipline that teams often lacked

LLMs address some of these issues:
- Natural language is more flexible than UML or DSLs
- No need for custom code generators
- Less tool lock-in (in theory)

But they introduce new problems:
- Non-determinism makes builds unreproducible
- Loss of formal verification and analysis
- Harder to ensure spec completeness
- Still at that awkward abstraction level

The key lesson from MDD isn't that code generation from specs is impossible—it's that the abstraction level matters enormously. MDD worked well for specific domains (embedded systems, telecoms) where the problem space was well-bounded and formally specifiable. It failed for general business applications where requirements are fuzzy and constantly changing.

SDD will likely follow a similar pattern: success in well-defined domains with stable requirements, struggles in chaotic problem spaces. The addition of Skills and domain-specific frameworks points toward this specialization—SDD may not be a general-purpose methodology, but rather a collection of domain-specific practices.

## The Practical Impact

When spec-driven development works well, it transforms how teams collaborate with AI coding agents. Instead of:

**Before**: "Build me a user authentication system" → 50 iterations of corrections

**After**: Start with an authentication spec (possibly from your healthcare skill library) → AI generates compliant, testable code that matches architectural patterns → PHR tracks the process → ADR documents why JWT was chosen over sessions

The difference is dramatic for the right problems:

- **Reduced iteration**: Clear specs mean fewer misunderstandings and rework
- **Increased quality**: Constitutional enforcement and domain-specific validations catch issues early
- **Better collaboration**: Specs, PHRs, and ADRs create shared understanding across team members and AI agents
- **Accelerated onboarding**: New developers (human or AI) can quickly understand system intent and constraints
- **Compliance confidence**: Audit trails and domain-specific checks reduce regulatory risk

But these benefits come at a cost:
- **Higher upfront investment**: Writing good specs takes time and skill
- **Review burden**: Specifications require careful review, sometimes more onerous than code review
- **Process overhead**: Multi-phase workflows may be overkill for simpler problems
- **Learning curve**: Teams need training in both SDD methodology and specific tools

## Moving Forward: Realistic Expectations

As we conclude this exploration of spec-driven development, it's important to set realistic expectations. SDD is not a silver bullet that will suddenly make AI coding agents reliable for all problems. Rather, it's an emerging practice area with genuine value in specific contexts.

**Where SDD Shows Promise:**
- Complex systems requiring architectural discipline
- Regulated industries needing audit trails and compliance evidence
- Greenfield projects with clear requirements
- Domains amenable to vertical specialization (healthcare, finance, etc.)
- Teams already practicing rigorous documentation

**Where SDD May Struggle:**
- Small bug fixes and routine maintenance
- Exploratory or research-oriented work
- Projects with rapidly changing requirements
- Teams new to specifications and documentation practices
- Chaotic problem spaces with unclear requirements

The tools available today—Kiro, Spec-Kit, Tessl, and others—are early explorations of this space. They represent valuable experiments in structuring human-AI collaboration, but they're not mature products ready for universal adoption. Each has significant trade-offs and unanswered questions about real-world effectiveness.

Our extensions to Spec-Kit—adding PHRs, ADRs, and vertical Skills—address some gaps, but also add complexity. The bet we're making is that this complexity pays dividends in specific domains where the cost of errors is high and the value of specialized knowledge is clear.

As AI coding agents continue to evolve, so will spec-driven development. The practices that succeed will likely be those that:
- **Right-size the process**: Offer lightweight approaches for simple problems, comprehensive frameworks for complex ones
- **Improve the review experience**: Make specification review better than code review, not just different
- **Acknowledge AI limitations**: Build in verification and validation rather than assuming AI perfection
- **Learn from history**: Take lessons from MDD and other attempts to generate code from higher-level artifacts
- **Specialize by domain**: Recognize that one-size-fits-all approaches struggle against domain-specific needs

For teams building serious, mission-critical applications in regulated industries or complex domains, spec-driven development isn't just a nice-to-have—it's becoming essential. As AI coding agents grow more capable, the bottleneck shifts from code generation to clear specification. The frameworks and practices explored in this chapter provide structure for that critical work.

The future of AI-assisted development isn't about AI that codes without guidance—it's about AI that codes from specifications that capture both what we want and why we want it. That's the promise of spec-driven development, and despite the challenges and open questions, it's a direction worth exploring.

## How the Trend Is Evolving
Spec Driven Development is fast becoming the backbone of serious AI software engineering. As code generation moves from novelty to necessity, specs will act as the **new APIs between humans and AI**.

They ensure:

- Predictable, explainable outcomes.
- Governance and compliance by design.
- Shared language between developers, agents, and auditors.

The shift from prompting to specifying mirrors the evolution from hand-coding to DevOps automation — it’s not just a technique, but a transformation in how we reason about software creation.

### Conclusion

Spec Driven Development is the bridge between human creativity and AI precision. It turns vague ideas into executable contracts, allowing coding agents to operate within clear boundaries and shared truths.

By starting with specs — not vibes — we ensure our AI collaborators build systems that **are correct by design, traceable by memory, and governed by principle**.

As the AI coding era matures, one thing is clear:
**The future of AI-assisted development will be written not in code first, but in specs.**
