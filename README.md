# Specifications for AI Native Software Development Book
**Colearning Agentic AI with Python and TypeScript – The AI & Spec Driven Way**

This repo contains all the specifications for Spec-Kit Plus using Claude Code/Gemini CLI/GPT-5-Codex to write the following complete book.

The book is geared towards teaching beginners how to program Modern Python, TypeScript, and Agentic AI in the new AI Driven Development (AIDD) era.

### Part 1: Introducing AI-Driven Development (4 chapters)
1. The AI Development Revolution: Disrupting the $3 Trillion Software Economy
2. AI Turning Point: The New Wave of AI Coding Agents Has Changed Everything for Developers
3. How to Make a Billion Dollars in the AI Era?
4. The Nine Pillar of AI Driven Development (AIDD)

### Part 2: AI Tool Landscape (4 chapters) 
5. How It All Started: The Claude Code Phenomenon
6. Google Gemini CLI: Open Source and Everywhere
7. Bash Essentials for AI-Driven Development
8. Git & GitHub for AI-Driven Development

### Part 3: Prompt & Context Engineering (2 chapters)
9. Prompt Engineering for AI-Driven Development
10. Context Engineering for AI-Driven Development

## Part 6: AI Native Software Development (3 chapters)

## Part 7: MCP Fundamentals with FastMCP (3 chapters)

## Part 8: TypeScript: The Language of Realtime and Interaction (3 Chapters)

## Part 9: Building Realtime and Voice Agents (3 Chapters)

## Part 10: Containerization & Orchestration using Docker and Kubernetes (3 Chapters)

## Part 11: Data, State, and Memory using PostgreSQL, Graph, and Vector Databases (3 Chapters)

## Part 12: Event-Driven Architecture using Kafka and Dapr (2 Chapters)

## Part 13: Stateful Agents using Dapr Actors and Dapr Workflows (2 Chapters)

Our sequence flows beautifully from “understanding the AI revolution” → “meeting the tools” → “learning to communicate” → “learning to code in Python” → “learning Spec Driven Development methodology” → “build OpenAI Agents in Python” → “build MCP servers” → “learn to code in TypeScript” → “build realtime and voice agents” → “deploy ai agents”
