# Specifications for Colearning Programming & Agentic AI with Python and TypeScript: The AI-Driven Way

This repo contains all the specifications for Spec-Kit Plus using Claude Code/Gemini CLI/GPT-5-Codex to write the following complete book:

## Colearning Programming & Agentic AI with Python and TypeScript: The AI-Driven Way

The book is geared towards teaching beginners how to program Modern Python, TypeScript, and Agentic AI in the new AI Driven Development (AIDD) era.

### Part 1: Introducing AI-Driven Development (4 chapters)
1. The AI Development Revolution: Disrupting the $3 Trillion Software Economy
2. AI Turning Point: The New Wave of AI Coding Agents Has Changed Everything for Developers
3. How to Make a Billion Dollars in the AI Era?
4. The Nine Pillar of AI Driven Development (AIDD)

### Part 2: AI Tool Landscape (4 chapters) 
5. How It All Started: The Claude Code Phenomenon
6. Google Gemini CLI: Open Source and Everywhere
7. Bash Essentials for AI-Driven Development
8. Git & GitHub for AI-Driven Development

### Part 3: Prompt & Context Engineering (2 chapters)
9. Prompt Engineering for AI-Driven Development
10. Context Engineering for AI-Driven Development

- Part 4: Python: The Language of AI Agents (12 chapters)
- Part 5: Spec-Kit Plus Methodology (3 chapters)
- Part 6: Agentic AI Fundamentals with OpenAI Agents SDK in Python (3 chapters)
- Part 7: MCP Fundamentals with FastMCP (3 chapters)
- Part 8: TypeScript: The Language of Realtime and Interaction (3 Chapters)
- Part 9: Building Realtime and Voice Agents (3 Chapters)
- Part 10: Containerization & Orchestration using Docker and Kubernetes (3 Chapters)
- Part 11: Data, State, and Memory using PostgreSQL, Graph, and Vector Databases (3 Chapters)
- Part 12: Event-Driven Architecture using Kafka and Dapr (2 Chapters)
- Part 13: Stateful Agents using Dapr Actors and Dapr Workflows (2 Chapters)

Our sequence flows beautifully from “understanding the AI revolution” → “meeting the tools” → “learning to communicate” → “learning to code in Python” → “learning Spec Driven Development methodology” → “build OpenAI Agents in Python” → “build MCP servers” → “learn to code in TypeScript” → “build realtime and voice agents” → “deploy ai agents”
