# Specifications for Colearning Programming & Agentic AI with Python and TypeScript: The AI-Driven Way

This repo contains all the specifications for Spec-Kit Plus using Claude Code/Gemini CLI/GPT-5-Codex to write the following complete book:

## Colearning Programming & Agentic AI with Python and TypeScript: The AI-Driven Way

- Part 1: Introducing AI-Driven Development (4 chapters)
- Part 2: AI Tool Landscape (4 chapters) ← Gemini, Claude, Codex overview
- Part 3: Prompt & Context Engineering (2 chapters)
- Part 4: Python: The Language of AI Agents (12 chapters)
- Part 5: Spec-Kit Plus Methodology (3 chapters)
- Part 6: Agentic AI Fundamentals with OpenAI Agents SDK in Python (3 chapters)
- Part 7: MCP Fundamentals with FastMCP (3 chapters)
- Part 8: TypeScript: The Language of Realtime and Interaction (3 Chapters)
